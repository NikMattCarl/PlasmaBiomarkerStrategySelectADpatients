# A Plasma Biomarker Strategy to Select Alzheimer’s Disease Patients for Anti-amyloid Immunotherapies

## Description
This repository contains code examples that showcase how plasma biomarkers can be evaluated to predict beta-amyloid status and tau PET status, providing an essential step in understanding the potential role of plasma biomarkers in patient selection for anti-amyloid immunotherapies in Alzheimer’s disease.

## Installation and Setup
Prerequisites: The code assumes that you have R and the required R packages installed.
Dataset: You will require a dataset to utilize the code. This dataset should consist of demographics, plasma biomarkers, and tau PET data. Note that no publicly available dataset is provided within this repository due to privacy and data-sharing constraints.

## Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Ensure that you have the necessary data available and modify paths in the code as needed.
Execute the R scripts in your preferred R environment or IDE.
